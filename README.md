Welcome to My Portfolio!

Hello! I’m just starting to learn PL/SQL and am a beginner in the field of programming. In this portfolio, you’ll find my early projects and the skills I’m developing with each step.

Each project represents a step towards mastering the fundamentals of programming and PL/SQL to solve problems using code. I’m eager to learn and improve, and I hope that through programming, I can create meaningful solutions.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I’d love to connect! I’m excited to learn from fellow learners, mentors, and anyone with an interest in technology.
