                    <p class="center-text">What is Badminton Sport?<br>
                        Badminton is a fast-paced racket sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles).<br>
                        The game is played on a rectangular court divided by a net.<br>
                        Players use rackets to hit a shuttlecock (a feathered or plastic projectile) back and forth over the net.<br>
                        The objective is to score points by landing the shuttlecock in the opponent's half of the court.</p>
                    <p class="center-text">The game of badminton, as we know it today, was introduced by the Duke of Beaufort in 1873 at his country estate,<br>
                        Badminton House, in Gloucestershire, England. The sport's roots can be traced back to ancient games like battledore and shuttlecock,<br>
                        which were played in Greece, China, and India. British army officers stationed in India during the 1860s adapted the game of "Poona" by adding a net,<br> 
                        and upon returning to England, they introduced it at the Duke's estate.</p>
